# python-pentesting
My background in technology is with selling hardware and software in the world of cybersecurity and network infrastructure, and extracurricularly, I have learned a ton about AWS and even more about coding in Python.
As ransomware attacks were reported to have increased by over 400% by Forbes in 2021, the concepts of ethical hacking, security vulnerabilities and awareness training, and digital privacy were mainstream and I 
spent so much time really understanding it both on and off the clock. I even presented on Log4J exploit to my coworkers. 
One thing I've learned in this field is that it isn't if, but when.
Python programming is always going to be my passion whether it ever becomes my profession or not,
and cyber threats will persist in this modern world. 
I want this repository to reflect how a passion for knowledge and for safety bred this desire to do something larger with the concepts, by pentesting in Python for organizations' vulnerabilities 
on the technical front first, but also read the comments of the code to understand what I, with what I know about cyber, would also recommend to remediate each of these situations. 

Special shoutout to my boyfriend for our anniversary gift in 2023 of the book "Black Hat Python" and Tails OS - never been so sure we are soulmates, I love you!
